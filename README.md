# CCOrcaLayerNumberFix
Post-processing script for OrcaSlicer to make layer numbers work on the Elegoo Centauri Carbon

## How to use
Download the latest release and add the path to it in `Post-processing Scripts` in OrcaSlicer. 

## How does it work
The script overwrites the start of the second line (normally "generated by OrcaSlicer") with "generated by ElegooSlicer".
