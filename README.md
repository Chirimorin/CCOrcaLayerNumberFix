# This script is obsolete

Instead of using a post-processing script, you can simply make these changes to your Orca settings instead:

Add to bottom of Machine Start G-code:  
`SET_PRINT_STATS_INFO TOTAL_LAYER=[total_layer_count]`

Add to Layer Change G-code:  
`SET_PRINT_STATS_INFO CURRENT_LAYER={layer_num + 1}`

# CCOrcaLayerNumberFix
Post-processing script for OrcaSlicer to make layer numbers work on the Elegoo Centauri Carbon

## How to use
Download the latest release and add the path to it in `Post-processing Scripts` in OrcaSlicer. 

## How does it work
The script overwrites the start of the second line (normally "generated by OrcaSlicer") with "generated by ElegooSlicer".
